# Hello, world!!

```clojure
user=> (println "hello, world")
hello, world
nil
```

Our first Clojure code is, of course, printing "Hello, world!".

# Booleans

```clojure
user=> true
true

user=> false
false
```

`true` and `false` are values of *Boolean* type just like in other programming languages.

# Strings

## Literals

```clojure
user=> "Hi, there!"
"Hi, there!"G
```

</br>

You can create a string by double-quoting text.

## Concatination


```clojure
user=> (+ "Good" " " "morning")

ClassCastException java.lang.String cannot be cast to java.lang.Number  clojure.lang.Numbers.add (Numbers.java:126)
```

</br>

`+` operator *doesn't* work to concat strings against your expectation.


```
user=> (use '[clojure.string :only [join]])
nil

user=> (join "" ["Good" " " "morning"])
"Good morning"
```

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

Instead, you can use `clojure.string/join`

# Integers

## Addition

```clojure
user=> (+ 2 3)
5
```

## Subtraction

```clojure
user=> (- 10 3)
7
```

## Multiplication

```clojure
user=> (* 10 2)
20
```

## Division

```clojure
user=> (/ 4 2)
2
```

```clojure
user=> (/ 4 3)
4/3
```

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

Interesting thing is that fraction is represented by ratio.

## Modulo

```clojure
user=> (mod 3 2)
1
```

<br>

Get modulus with `mod`

## Max

```clojure
user=> (max 1 2 3 4 5)  
5
```

<br>

Get the greatest and smallest number with `max`.

## Min

```clojure
user=> (min 5 4 3 2 1)
1
```

<br>

Get the smallest number with `min`.

## Power

```clojure
user=> (defn power
  [x n]
  (reduce * (repeat n x))
)

user=> (power 2 3)
8
```

Clojure doesn't provide built-in function for exponential operation.

Define a function `power`. `reduce` takes a sequence generated by `repeat` and compute `*` against each element of the sequence and returns the sum. The sum is used to do `*` against the next element of the sequence.

## Bigint

```clojure
user=> (+ (bigint Long/MAX_VALUE) 10)
9223372036854775817N
```

<br>

You can use `bigint` to handle really big number.

# Lists

## Literal

```clojure
user=> `(1 2 3)
(1 2 3)
```

<br>

Lists are simple collection of values. You can create a list by grouping values with paren with **`** at the top. We need '`' because list will be evaluated without it.

## Get element by index

```clojure
user=> (nth `(1 2 3) 1)
2
```

<br>

To get a value from list, you use `nth` with index number. Index starts from 0

## Count

```clojure
user=> (count `(1 2 3) )
3
```

<br>

To count how many values in the list, you use `count`.

## Add element

```clojure
user=> (conj `(1 2 3) 4)
(4 1 2 3)
```

<br>

To add a value to the list, you use `conj` (conj[oin]). Note that the new value is added to the top.

## Remove element

How to remove a value from a list? You can't really remove a value from list in Clojure. That's not what list is supposed to do.
If you are writing a program that needs to remove from collection, you should use other type of collection such as `Set`.
